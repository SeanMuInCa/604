<HASH TABLE>

important params is load factor

two ways to deal with dupulicate index in hash table

seperate chaining, using an arraylist(in code);

open addressing, (hash + increment) % size
3 types liner, double hashing, quadratic(second time)

when deleting you need to add dummyobject into that position to replace the old data, and then re(hash + increment) % size
